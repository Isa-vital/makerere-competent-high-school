                                <p>From time to time, we identify learners who might need special support. These are in various categories e.g., the undisciplined, the poor performers, etc. We therefore have arrangements to meet with parents of these learners in the course of the holiday.</p>

                                <p>While a majority of students are adhering to school rules and regulations, there is a concerning trend of poor behavior among some students which affects the learning environment. There is a group of students who still escape from school, drink alcohol, disrespect authority, and other ill behaviors that directly contradict with the school rules and regulations. Despite the many approaches to curb the behaviors, there is not a positive response at all.</p>
                                <p>The school has therefore, in collaboration with the disciplinary committee advised some of the students to change school and to others, the school administration will organize and meet with their parents before the term begins.</p>
